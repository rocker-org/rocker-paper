@article{Boettiger2015,
  abstract =     {As computational work becomes more and more integral
                  to many aspects of scientific research,
                  computational reproducibility has become an issue of
                  increasing importance to computer systems
                  researchers and domain scientists alike. Though
                  computational reproducibility seems more straight
                  forward than replicating physical experiments, the
                  complex and rapidly changing nature of computer
                  environments makes being able to reproduce and
                  extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper,
                  I explore common reasons that code developed for one
                  research project cannot be successfully executed or
                  extended by subsequent researchers. I review current
                  approaches to these issues, including virtual
                  machines and workflow systems, and their
                  limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging
                  technology Docker combines several areas from
                  systems research - such as operating system
                  virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular
                  re-usable elements, versioning, and a 'DevOps'
                  philosophy, to address these challenges. I
                  illustrate this with several examples of Docker use
                  with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

  abstract =     { Modern statistics is fundamentally a computational
                  discipline, but too often this fact is not reflected
                  in our statistics curricula. With the rise of big
                  data and data science it has become increasingly
                  clear that students both want, expect, and need
                  explicit training in this area of the
                  discipline. Additionally, recent curricular
                  guidelines clearly state that working with data
                  requires extensive computing skills and that
                  statistics students should be fluent in accessing,
                  manipulating, analyzing, and modeling with
                  professional statistical analysis software. Much has
                  been written in the statistics education literature
                  about pedagogical tools and approaches to provide a
                  practical computational foundation for
                  students. This article discusses the computational
                  infrastructure and toolkit choices to allow for
                  these pedagogical innovations while minimizing
                  frustration and improving adoption for both our
                  students and instructors.  },
